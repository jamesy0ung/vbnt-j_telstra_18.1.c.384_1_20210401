/**
 * Configuration dependency that can track the availability of a (valid) configuration. To use
 * it, specify a PID for the configuration. The dependency is always required, because if it is
 * not, it does not make sense to use the dependency manager. In that scenario, simply register
 * your service as a <code>ManagedService(Factory)</code> and handle everything yourself. Also,
 * only managed services are supported, not factories. There are a couple of things you need to
 * be aware of when implementing the <code>updated(Dictionary)</code> method:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Make sure it throws a <code>ConfigurationException</code> when you get a configuration
 * that is invalid. In this case, the dependency will not change: if it was not available, it
 * will still not be. If it was available, it will remain available and implicitly assume you
 * keep working with your old configuration.</li>
 * <li>This method will be called before all required dependencies are available. Make sure you
 * do not depend on these to parse your settings.</li>
 * </ul>
