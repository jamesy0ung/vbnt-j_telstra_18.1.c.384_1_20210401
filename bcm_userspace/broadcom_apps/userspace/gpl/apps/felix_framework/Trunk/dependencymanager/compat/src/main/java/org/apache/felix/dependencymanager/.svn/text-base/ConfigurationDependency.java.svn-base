/**
 * Configuration dependency that can track the availability of a (valid) configuration.
 * To use it, specify a PID for the configuration. The dependency is always required,
 * because if it is not, it does not make sense to use the dependency manager. In that
 * scenario, simply register your service as a <code>ManagedService(Factory)</code> and
 * handle everything yourself. Also, only managed services are supported, not factories.
 * There are a couple of things you need to be aware of when implementing the
 * <code>updated(Dictionary)</code> method:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Make sure it throws a <code>ConfigurationException</code> when you get a
 * configuration that is invalid. In this case, the dependency will not change:
 * if it was not available, it will still not be. If it was available, it will
 * remain available and implicitly assume you keep working with your old
 * configuration.</li>
 * <li>This method will be called before all required dependencies are available.
 * Make sure you do not depend on these to parse your settings.</li>
 * </ul>
