This example is based on the Ivy Tutorial multi-project example:
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/tutorial/multiproject.html

Dependencies are resolved using an OBR index for the Spring repository,
hosted at sigil.codecauldron.org.

projects/sigil-defaults.properties specifies default package version ranges,
which are inherited by the -imports in sigil.properties.

1. set ivy.jar location in common/build.properties

2. test build order (determined automatically from the dependencies)
$ ant order

3. build
$ ant publish
