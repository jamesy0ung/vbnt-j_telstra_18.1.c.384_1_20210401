Compatibility
-------------
Version 15.09:
* Language tag matching uses prefix matching and also will return the default
  language if there is no match where previously it would return an
  error. (ASACORE-2209)
* Claimed 15.09 apps/devices (A/D using Security 2.0) cannot interact securely
  with pre-15.09 A/D using ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange; further, if the A/D only
  exposes interfaces/objects requiring security it will not be possible to
  interact with the A/D. This is because once an A/D is claimed, it expects to
  receive a manifest from the ECDHE_ECDSA peer, and pre-15.09 A/D do not support
  sending manifests (which were introduced as part Security 2.0 in the 15.09
  release).
